// This are all disjointed Dialogue Nodes to be called as part of the work mini game
// Doki will get a gray image and be asked by a co-worker to make changes
// The co-worker will check that Doki did what they asked then review with the higher up
// The higher up will disapprove of the changes several times
// Eventually the changes will amount to going back to the gray image
// The higher up will accept and the work mini game will finish

// TLDR: Doki will be given a gray image, then make several changes, only to end with a gray image.
